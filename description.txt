Soul Sanguisuge is a mod that allows you to gather Monster Souls (which are currently crafted with various mob drops, but I plan to make them actually drop soon™) and convert them into useful gear.

It's intended to be used alongside mods that expand the game past the Moon Lord (such as Calamity and Thorium), or just content mods in general; but can be used by itself.


Current content:

Recipe for the Slime Staff & a few other vanilla items

An upgradable sword (has 10 levels and 2 optional forms) [note: this is getting changed in v2.0]

~20-ish new accessories (most of which are able to be upgraded throughout the game)

2 new buffs 
- 2 potions that activate the new buffs

A new healing potion past Super

A few food items (gives Well Fed for 7 minutes)

4 items that can be crafted early on to store your Coins in (because why not?) [mainly to be used with Master Mode, if I can ever update the mod to Terraria 1.4]
