Soul Sanguisuge is a mod that allows you to gather Monster Souls (which are currently crafted with various mob drops, but I plan to make them actually drop soonâ„¢) and convert them into useful gear. It's based on old versions of a mod called Ersion (which has pretty much been abandoned now).

Intended to be used alongside mods that expand the game past the Moon Lord (such as Calamity and Thorium), (or just content mods in general), but can be used by itself. I'm trying to strike a good balance when it comes to the game stage items can be made at (e.g. the sword can be used from the beginning to the end of the game)


Current content:

A new Luck potion! (Grants it for 30 minutes)

An upgradable sword (has 3 levels and 2 specialized forms)

An upgradable bow (has 3 levels)

~20-ish new accessories (most of which are able to be upgraded throughout the game)

2 new buffs
- 2 potions that activate the new buffs

A new healing potion past Super (heals 350)

A new food item (gives Well Fed for 7 minutes)

And a quest fish (not sure why you'd try to catch it though...)
